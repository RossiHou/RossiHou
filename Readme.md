# Introduction
Hello, I'm Weitao Hou, a PhD student focusing on Geospatial theories and method development at Curtin University. Prior to this, I completed my MSc degree at the National University of Singapore and my BEng at Northwest Normal University.

Besides, I used to provide English listening and translation subtitle services for NBA videos, including official content, interviews, and post-game press conferences for players.

PS1: I am a whisky nerd, I enjoy most of the Scotch and some of the Burbon. GlenDornoch 18 (BW edition) and Bookers burbon are my favorites!
